In 1955, John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon proposed the Dartmouth Summer Research Project, the workshop where the term "artificial intelligence" was coined. Early researchers were optimistic that human-level machine intelligence was just years away.',
              'That optimism ran into hard limits. In 1973, a UK government-commissioned review known as the Lighthill Report concluded that AI research had failed to deliver on its grand promises, and funding cuts followed on both sides of the Atlantic: the first of two periods of reduced funding and interest known as "AI winters," roughly the mid-1970s and again the late 1980s into the early 1990s, as early approaches failed to scale to real-world problems.',

In 2012, a neural network called AlexNet, trained on the ImageNet dataset, won an image-recognition contest with a 15.3% error rate against the field’s next-best 26.2%, a result widely credited with kicking off the current boom, made possible by more data, more powerful graphics processors, and better algorithms.

Perception is the idea that computers can sense the world through cameras, microphones, and other sensors. Representation & Reasoning is the idea that a system stores what it "knows" in some internal form and uses it to draw conclusions.',

Societal Impact, the fifth idea, is the reminder that every AI system has real effects on real people, for better or worse, which is the focus of this course’s ethics module.',

A 2021 follow-up technique, latent diffusion, made this practical to run efficiently and added text-prompt guidance at each denoising step. Once trained on millions of image-caption pairs, the model can start from pure random noise and gradually "denoise" it into a brand new image, guided at each step by your text prompt.',
